 ❌ Read and render meshes, maybe only just some... deal with how bevy handles composite actors.
 ❌ Read textures and add them to bevy::TextureAtlas, refer to them from the meshes.
     ❌ Convert to megatexture
     ❌ Texture placement in atlas

 ❌ Resource loading from files
 ❌ Compose animatable models from disparate Car resources
 ❌ Set up bevy animation systems for each model
 ❌ Set up view and camera
 ❌ Render

 ❌ BGLSPIKE.PIX in DecodedData/DATA/PIXELMAP/EAGYELE.PIX - check transparency
 ❌ Load models using Kaitai Struct
